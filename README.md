# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-for-Stocks

A Monte Carlo simulation for stocks is a statistical technique used to model the potential outcomes of a stock's price over time, incorporating the randomness inherent in market movements. It's a powerful tool for assessing risks and probabilities in financial markets. Here's how it typically works:

Historical Data Analysis: First, you analyze historical price data of a stock to estimate its volatility (the standard deviation of its returns) and average return. These parameters help in modeling the stock's future price movements.

Random Variable Generation: Using the estimated parameters, you generate a series of random daily returns, typically assuming that these returns follow a normal distribution (or another chosen distribution based on the asset behavior).

Price Simulation: For each random return generated, you calculate the stock price for the next day by applying the return to the current stock price. This process is repeated for as many days into the future as you wish to simulate.

Repetition for Multiple Paths: This entire process is repeated multiple times (e.g., thousands of simulations) to create a variety of possible future price paths for the stock.

Analysis of Results: The final step involves analyzing these simulated paths to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes, such as reaching a certain price target, or dropping below a certain level. This analysis helps in understanding the risks and potential returns.

Monte Carlo simulations are highly customizable and can include more complex features such as varying interest rates, different types of distributions for returns, or incorporating specific events (like earnings announcements).
